MAKE A HEATMAP of the neighborhoods in berlin where most of the audience live

- **is it justified for the forum to be there at all ? a lot of tax money is flowing into the forum**
- about 500M ??? and only hundreds were from private donations
  the government said they don't want their money to be used for baroque, it's their alibi to be distanced from the heat

- the private money has only been used for the baroque facade (why ? who is profiting from it ?)

* see if the names of the people who donated are mentioned in the forum correspond to the data gathered
* does this institution, in the center of berlin, represents its citizens (neoliberal urban development)

** marketing or brand identity ? **
=========> -- CITY MARKETING -- <=========

text is SELLING PLACES
also the first text that we read
and neoliberal urban development

look at THEIR bibliography
