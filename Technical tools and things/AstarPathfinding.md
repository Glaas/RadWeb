# AstarPathfinding

- ***G cost*** = Distance from current node to start node
- ***H cost*** = Distance from current node to target node
- ***F cost*** = G + H cost

H cost is optimistic; will be right or under evaluate

The idea is just to always choose the cheaper F cost over and over until we reach the target node

Nice [video](https://youtu.be/i0x5fj4PqP4) about it
