Even not looking at how \\\"fun\\\" the game is (which was never the focus of the class in the first place) we delivered a product of relatively high complexity, containing modular systems that interact elegantly with each other, respecting multiple well-established code principles, such as SOLID, KISS, DRY, etc.\\nAfter extensive testing by ourselves and some very patient volunteers, we could not find any visible bugs in the current state of the game. It is a fully playable game that respects the goal of the class: being modifiable at runtime, remotely.\\nTo continue on the deliverables : we went the extra mile to make extra tools to aid us in our goal. From a in-game console that allows the manipulation of most aspects of the game, to a fully fledged android app that allows the developer to adjust the game values with a dedicated interface, as well as two features that permitted us to gather feedback, both manually and automatically.\\nThe game and these tools are also fully documented on a dedicated wiki.\"), mdx(\"hr\", null), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Now, the more abstract reasons.\\nWe knew from the start that building this project with a two-person team would be a challenge.

What I am really proud of, is that in the conflicts and divergences, we not only found compromises, but made actual research and put work into building a workflow that we both felt good in, and that allowed the both of us to be the best version of our work selves.
