Color of axis : RGB = XYZ
So X = Red, Y = Green, Z = Blue
`sign(x) = direction (positive or negative)`
`abs(x) = length/magnitude`
`distance(a,b) = abs(b-a)`

> Vectors don't have a root and a tip, they only have a tip. This is important to make the distinction between point and direction. They start at zero.

For every number in the vector `(2,1)`, each number is called a **component.**

If you want to add two vectors (1,2) and (3,4), you add the components.
So `(1+3, 2+4)` = `(4,6)`.
