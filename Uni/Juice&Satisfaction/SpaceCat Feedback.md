### Neato üîÜ‚ú®
- Super impressive how few bugs there are
- The score number going up after the end of a level is a super nice touch
- Crazy amount of polish, everything reacts
- The cutscene is legit professional cartoon quality, it's nothing short of absolutely umbelievelably good
- The gatcha system makes sense for replayability and works super well !
- Although I'm not super fond of the aesthetic, the character design was just absurdly good. It's not just good, it's genuinely charming to a professional level.

### Too bad üò∂

- The fact that I decide when a level is finished or not makes the high score kind of pointless because it removes the "competitive" element introduced by the idea of a high score
- Pineapple finishing a level should be communicated more clearly, had to guess
- It's an absolute crime how much work went into the gacha system and how beautiful and polished it is, while being so missable !!! Why !! I saw it after I was done playing and I was so bummed about it !
- The lack of indications on where to go and what to do made it really difficult to find an objective or a purpose (like in life üò•)
- Unclear which things are attracted to me (like... in life ???)
- Bouncing around was great, but I really did not to get bounced around. I wanted to **master** the movement.
- Am I trying to be quick or get a high score ???
- The game's frenetic pace does not allow for the player to master the mechanics, which is a shame ! You're kind of "forced" to bounce around in a frenetic manner

### Remarks & Suggestions ‚úè
- Returning to main menu from the game would be really neato !
- The lack of precise control makes it more unfair when you punish the player with a time penalty

### Bugs ? üêõ
- LOTS of frames dropped when collecting a lot of elements
- "Next" button at the end of level 6 just reloads level 6
- Pressing the "Next" button at the end of a level, apparently do not send you to the next level in numerical order ? Super confusing

## Conclusion üéâ
What you have is nothing short of incredible for a uni project. A shame that the game design in itself was not iterated on more, because everything that is around it is insulting by just how high quality it is.
It's a super great and polished and charming piece of software, but not a game that I enjoy playing that much.
