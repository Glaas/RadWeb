# Notes presentation


### Pause menu
- Show your build with the pause menu, explain what will make it in by today / next week

### Database 
On http://pouchdb.gd-ue.de/_utils/
- Show Shadowsquid database and show that it's empty
- Explain that, in the spirit of the class, given that the spreadsheet works, we decided to take on the opportunity to familiarise ourselves with more online components. We saw that great Subnautica video by People Make Games and decided our project could use that.
- Make sure you're on the Feedback Form branch, and in game, send a feedback form
- Switch back to PouchDB, show that the form is there

- Conclude by saying that we we'll probably move our spreadsheet to the database, and create a convenient way to edit the data remotely
