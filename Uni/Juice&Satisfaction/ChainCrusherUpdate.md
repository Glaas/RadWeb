# Chain Crusher Update

## Priority
        Improve on the game in order to make it more compelling and add a sense of progress
We discussed touching any of our prototypes, and the final choice was on Chain Crusher.

## Power-ups / Upgrades
We discussed implementing power-ups, such as :
#### Shield 
Protection from next enemy attack(s)
#### Bigger ball
#### Multiple balls
Either all attached to the main body or in a flail-like fashion
#### Improved Special Attack
#### Electricity Chain Reaction
When an enemy it hit by the special attack, it triggers a chain reaction that destroys the enemy unfortunate enough to be too close.

## Plan of action
- Seb ; implementing the logic behind the Electricity upgrade 
- Gereon ; implementing the visuals behind the Electricity upgrade 
- Fred ; Building and structuring the progression system

**The rest can wait !**


---
## Decision on changes
- Set up a progression gauge that would reflect player's overall progress towards the next step.

---
## Misc. *Improvements and fixes*
- Displaying the health in an improved way (Radial life bar ?)
- Enemies and bullets could be faster / more aware of the position of the player
- Better enemy management (having more control on the spawners and conditions of spawn)
- Making the purpose of the black hole more clear / repurposing the black hole into enemies spawning animation
- Grid in the background could shift hue over time
