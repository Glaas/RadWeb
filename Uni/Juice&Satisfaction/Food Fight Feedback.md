# Food Fight Feedback

- Font is not readable !
- Enemy getting stuck prevented the next wave from starting
- Sitting in a corner and just holding left click is sadly a viable strategy
- Super cool to have a boss, but 1hitKO is too harsh
- I never have a reason to not be clicking, so in the end I just put something on my LCTRL key 
- Pixel art is super cute, but Im not sure about the choice of post processing, like the chromatic aberration and the scanlines. It is well implemented but does not feel like it respond to your aesthetic (modern crisp pixel art with unlimited color palette and super modern music vs. aliased pixel art with linited palette and frame count)
- Gereon point with Art Dir
