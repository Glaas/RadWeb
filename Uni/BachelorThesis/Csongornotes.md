there are some games that already teach game literacy 


"where is the line between game litteracy and how you would need to beat a speific game ?"

Portal 2 Tutorial teaches you how to move although the first did too (and also other games did that)

Where's "the line??" What is "early"?

Portal is teaching the controls, but not how to play the game, and the intuition to follow the line


"Where does games fail at teaching elementary litteracy ?"
(portal tries to make simple but fails at telling the player to move forward)

Iwata biography could be a good read ! Allowing players who don't play games to play games

games put at exhibitions needs to be playable for artists, could look into that !!
they considered making tutorials room ??

Tutorial cart in level design pawn cart links

Look into AFFORDANCE
What could you afford ? important topic!!!

for ex: the wiimote is supposed to recall a remote and make adults less afraid to use it

what is actual game literacy, not only the rights buttons to press but to also do things without thinking about it

i should break down my topics into several one
making chapters for my BA !!! exciting !!!
