# Seminar Paper


first 100 days were for free (but only for the exhibition) (data prolly generated on a yearly basis)
- main question : why are the communities from which the items are coming from are not profiting from the exhibition ?
also, it is not only about the profit, but also, who does that attract ? ppl come to berlin just for the humboldt forum and generates money in hostels, etc
- for who is it exactly accessible ? concerned can't just come to berlin, transport, visas

**stole from the past, and is still stealing today**

how come that the current director of the forum is former british museum ? why ?

commodification of culture
