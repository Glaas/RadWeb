https://www.no-humboldt21.de

seminar paper should me around 25k characters (around 10 pages)

need to find an angle and write about it


the dissonance between message sent by public institutions, what they want to commmermorate, and what they actually do 

- what message does it send when culture and memory are accessible only to the wealthy
- What are the price ranges and how does that affect the audience
- WHAT is the actual demographic targeted by the humnoldt forum
- how to they advertise ? how do they market themselves ?
- pointing at the hypocrisy (rising rents in berlin vs. cafe a 7 euros a la sortie de l'exposition)


    museums in the UK are for free
