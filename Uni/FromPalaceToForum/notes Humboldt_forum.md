# notes Humboldt forum


went for the Berlin global exhibition. Super shallow and surface level, only a couple of the 7 / 8 exhibitions was actually trying.
super nice to hear them complaining about the rise of the rents in Berlin, only to welcome us with a big "welcome back" hug with the café right at the exit, where 4 olives will cost you 6.5e. 

seminar paper : has to be related to the Forum, but not necessary related to the text I'm working on

first physical class on dev 6 for colloquium (16 ppl)
