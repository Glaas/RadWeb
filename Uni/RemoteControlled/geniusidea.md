- What would a game design need to REQUIRE a remote controlled part ? How do you justify the existence of those systems ? What could not be baked inside the game from the start ?
the idea is to have a "web" of players. Every player could opt in or out of being part of the web.
Joining the web would have perks. The more player join the web, the greater the perks of the web are. (cookie clicker herald system)
but joining the web also means that at any point in time, you could be victim from another player pillaging your resources for their own profit. 

It makes it worth it to have a remote controlled part; tweaking those perks can only be done if you have the game running, meaning that you can really only make **meaningful changes** at **runtime**.
