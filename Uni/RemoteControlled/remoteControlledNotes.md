# Remote Controlled notes

Remote repo test first push

3d game recommended

== Prototype needs to be done in the next 4 weeks with remote controlled part in minds ==

-= Need to adopt parts that are on Miro in some capacity -= 

[2021-10-12]
[ ] Idea 1 : A restaurant where people outside of the game get to place orders
[ ] Idea 2 : Sending commands in the game through texts
[√] Idea 3 : Shooter or procgen game where outside players can generate content for the main player

Need game design, need documentation, need to be able to hand out the game to someone else, need to do everything on the small scale, be careful with dictatorship

[√] Figure out documentation, GDD and personal journal
[ ] Figure out who does what
[ ] Create communication channels
[ ] Expectections gameplay and scope
[√] Expectections art side
[ ] Leadership roles

! Wiki : Marie will do overall structure and orga, with contributions by Seb !

Marie would lean in heavily on concept art
We decided that I would take on most of the technical side, however Marie would inhehit some of the isolated coding challenges

! Veyry important is we both have to leave a heavy footprinton the project, so I should be careful on not taking too many things on my shoulders. !


[ ] Give Marie a Blender course on how to do PS1 graphics
[ ] Starting the wiki to put all of the things thare are locked down (and put that onto Miro for Burger to see)
Things to put on wiki:
--> Roles and work distribution
--> Genre, medium, aesthetic


Art : mixed
Technical aspect : 90 10 seb Marie
