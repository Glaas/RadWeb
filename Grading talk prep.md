# Grading talk prep

_Why do I deserve better than a 3.0?_

First, I will go over the very concrete reasons; the deliverables.
Our team delivered a robust piece of software that was well-tested and well-documented. Even not looking at how "fun" the game is (which was never the focus of the class in the first place) we delivered a product of relatively high complexity, containing modular systems that interact elegantly with each other, respecting multiple well-established code principles, such as SOLID, KISS, DRY, etc.
After extensive testing by ourselves and some very patient volunteers, we could not find any visible bugs in the current state of the game. It is a fully playable game that respects the goal of the class: being modifiable at runtime, remotely.
To continue on the deliverables : we went the extra mile to make extra tools to aid us in our goal. From a in-game console that allows the manipulation of most aspects of the game, to a fully fledged android app that allows the developer to adjust the game values with a dedicated interface, as well as two features that permitted us to gather feedback, both manually and automatically.
The game and these tools are also fully documented on a dedicated wiki.

Now, the more abstract reasons.
We knew from the start that building this project with a two-person team would be a challenge. Being too close to your colleagues can easily be a recipe for disaster, and spending eleven months in the same room could very much be what most people would consider "too close".
Yet, it worked out ! What I am really proud of, is that in the conflicts and divergences, we not only found compromises, but made actual research and put work into building a workflow that we both felt good in, and that allowed the both of us to be the best version of our work selves. I think we both did a great job at both voicing out our concerns and complaints, and to also listen to each other.

And lastly : our organization and smart use of our tools allowed us to always deliver on time, respect all of our deadlines, and never be in a state where the project would be a burning mess that we have to put out with great urgency. As soon as the game had a playable game loop, we always had a playable version containing the latest features, at any moment, drastically reducing the amount of stress.

Finally: what I would consider our biggest success, is that we **BOTH** came out of this project having learned a lot of things on topics we were not familiar with, strengthened our skills, and despite the hardships, our working _and_
personal relationship is stronger than ever.
