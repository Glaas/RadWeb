# Project Courses notes

## Run !

Emphasis on movement, was our first big project.
People were mostly happy, however the lack of technical proficiency made for some really janky prototypes and games in the end.  
What also hurt the end result too is Csongor being too vague about what exactly he wanted the final result to be like. A full game ? A prototype ? A proof of concept ? The vagueness made for some frustration.

## Remote Controlled games

## Juice and Satisfaction

People were really happy with the project in general. The biggest gripe students had was how the topic was taught and approached, but otherwise, people had a lot of fun and 


--> Having a theme is good, especially if it's optional. However, a bad theme is worse than no theme at all. **Physics**, for the Juice and Satisfaction class, was a bad theme, especially since we weren't really free to put a twist on it.  
--> There are a lot of Jams on Itch with fantastic themes, could be a good source of inspiration !
--> Maybe think about if you want the final result to be a portfolio piece or not, because it might influence students' approach to their project. Florian Berger likes to advertise that every project is a portfolio piece, but in reality project courses are not always articulated in that direction. (We have to apply for internship this semester)
