### Praise 

- Aesthetics and visuals : people are SUPER happy with how the game looks. The neon, the bouncing in sync with the audio, the endless visual feedback to player input.
Lots of praise on the Particle Systems especially, and specifically on the final explosion as well as the portals.
Nobody noticed the freezing portals at all. Like, ever.

### Not Great

- Game is super easy to break right now. Main bugs are :
  - Chain super easy to break after a couple of special attacks
  - The way Iframes are implemented right now, is disabling the collider of the player. That was a huge mistake on my side, as the player can super easily go out of bounds.
  - Special attack essentially became a Pandora's box, you never know what bugs you're gonna cause.

```
I feel like the main bug is really the chain breaking. If that's solved, many other bugs will get solved at the same time.

### Remarks

- Building momentum (like Gereon likes, making the ball spin around the player with a good rythm) received a lot of praise. However, there were mixed feelings about that momentum being broken when the ball hits an enemy or a bullet. Some people wanted the ball to keep going a crush multiple enemies, leading to more crowd control.
