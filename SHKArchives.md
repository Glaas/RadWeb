#### Miro archiving

From this link ;

Only *board owners* within **paid** plans can archive and back up Miro boards.
Currently I'm just a simple user of Uhrwerk Orange so I don't have that kind of permission.

The [API](https://developers.miro.com/reference/introduction#introduction) does not really allow to move file around, it's more target towards IT work like creating Teams and assigning roles and stuff, so that will have to be done manually

- Archived Miro board should be put into GD archive

#### Sharepoint archiving
- the [API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/sp-add-ins/complete-basic-operations-using-sharepoint-client-library-code) is also really not helpful with it comes to move files

### Tell Csongor
- I need to be a board owner on Miro if I want to back up anything
