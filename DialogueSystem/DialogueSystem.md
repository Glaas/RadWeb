# Yet Unnamed Minimalistic Dialogue System (YUMDS)

## Getting started

- 
## Main Components

### Talk

* In the inspector
  
This script should sit on your player. At the time of writing, it has only one exposed property, named `Player Chat Bubble Color`. (More on that below.)

* Internally

In the `Update()` function, `Talk` will keep a list of all objects 

**NOTES:**
- Make sure your NPCs have the tag "NPC", otherwise they won't be detected by `Talk`.
- The NPC you will talk to will always be the CLOSEST to the player.
- The player movement will be disabled during a conversation, by design.
