## Collision check list
1. Make a summary image or diagram with arrows
2. One of the actors must have a non-static rb
3. Check the 2D vs 3D (colliders and rb)
4. Check the methods (2d and 3d) and arguments
5. Check the layers and verify they are assigned, not just created
6. check the tags and the compare tags
7. check the collision matrix
8. if trigger, check the "is trigger"
9. check that the code is living on the correct gameobjects
10. Check that both objects are active
11. verify with gizmos that they are indeed intersecting
